# One Stop Shop

Hello! Here at SIF, we use a lot of technology and sometimes technology support is minimal for devices that we depend on.

As such, these documents tell you how to set up the Oculus Rift DK2 headset on some of the older machines.

Keep in mind that we are not responsible for anything that you do on your device. Also, these guides may not work for all machines. Generally, you will need some sort of integrated graphics card on your device.
